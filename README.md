# MaterialFX (WIP)

MaterialFX is an open source Java library which provides material components for JavaFX

This projects aims to be a successor to [JFoenix](https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix) library.  
As of now I have redone only the material button class, here's a preview:

I will start pushing commits as soon as possible, I just want to make sure the components I make are enough good and usable so keep an eye for updates.
